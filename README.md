# Introduction

At this step we will discuss a couple of other options for project management tools.

# Overview of all in one tools

So for all-in-one tools, two popular tools are Planscope and Solo.

With such tool you pay less and there is a single app that you have to learn. However, it is a little harder to adjust it to specific needs or processes depending on what you need.

Solo includes invoicing, time tracking, data reports, basic CRM features and project management and it starts at $14 a month. This is one of the very few tools out there that is an all in one tool that is built specifically for freelancers.

Planscope on the other hand is intended more for agencies and small teams and it includes project management features estimate, proposal features, time and budget tracking and reports and it starts at $50 a month for three users.

The one thing is that neither of those does have a mobile app.

# Overview of Droptask

Droptask is a visual tool that has project management features: you can attach files, create recurring tasks, mark it by priority and more. It's got a really simple drag and drop interface and I really like it, however it doesn't have a calendar view.

The free plan is totally usable. The paid plan starts at $6 a user a month. It does have an iPhone and Android app.

# Overview of Todoist

For a minimalist list-based app there is Todoist. It has a very minimalist appearance but there is a surprising amount of depth within the tool itself. Similar to Wunderlist, this is really good for Getting Things Done users and you can upgrade for $29 a year to get features like creating project templates, file attachments and os on.

Todoist might be a good alternative to Wunderlist. It provides a lot of apps (desktop, iPhone, iPad, Android), extensions for all browsers and GMail Postbox.

There are recurring tasks, you can track productivity and with premium account you can create labels and filters. You can add notes or reminders, prioritize things, add subtasks and subprojects. Todoist is equally flexible whether it's just you or whether you work with someone else.

# Overview of Flow

Last but not the least is Flow. Flow is very similar to Asana in a lot of ways. It's intended for solo users and small teams. Flow has a bit more features than Asana, like prioritization of tasks and sub tasks. It also provides a daily view in addition to the drag and drop calendar views.

However, you will have to pay for those extra features because it starts at $19 per month for three users. So it's really intended to be used by small teams instead of just one person.
